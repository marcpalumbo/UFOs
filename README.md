# Overview of Project
The purpose of this module and challenge was to expand upon our programming knowledge to create webapages that can display data, and utlize filters to look for specific data. The challenging parts of this module included the learning of another new language. While some things remain consistent across the different languages, the slight variations and approach can lead a new learner into major roadblocks. Some challenges I personally incurred included jumping back and forth from HTML and JSS. I was confused at first as to where the connection was made but later on figured it out in a class session thanks to the help of another student. The prospect of creating and designing web pages peaked my interest more than previous concepts throughout this course/ 

## Results
Below is a screenshotted image of how the webpage now looks. One thing I could not figure out was how to get the paragraph to the side of the screen and not on top of each other like it was listed in the coursework. I am looking forward to seeing how the CSS style can be incorporated in other ways, as well as figuring out how to lay webpages out with greater aesthetic.

Below is screenshotted example of what it looks like when you apply a filter to any of the text boxes. As long the text inputted on the page matches something thats stored in the data, it will filter once you press enter.

Creating this was difficult for me. I had to use class resources in order to get my code to work work here. I had initially ommitted some crucial part of the code, that rendered the webpage unusable, but was able to get it to work using "d3.select" in mu updateFilters() function. Once this was addressed everything worked as planned.

## Summary

This module gave me an idea of what may be possible in terms of building a portfolio. An independant project I want to pursue is some form of user facing web page that can filter out sports data. Most like NFL data since that's my favorite sport. The possibilities are truly endless in terms of what can be done as long as I can find data to work with. However, once I have it, that may be the easiest part of it all!
